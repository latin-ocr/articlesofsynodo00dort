and certain futurition, in any form that can be imagined 3
and all the shocking consequences with which they
charge Calvinism, are quite as legitimately chargeable
against any and every scheme, short of atheism, which

No other proof of this is needed than the subterfuges
to which Arminians and Pelagians have resorted in order
to obviate the objections which they have felt pressing 011

difficulties, take refuge in the principle that the Most
High is deficient in power as well as in knowledge, that
his plan—so far as he has any—is continually thwarted
and opposed beyond his power of control 3 that he
would be glad to have less natural and moral evil in his
kingdom than exists 3 would be glad to have many more
saved than will be saved, but is not able to fulfil his

settled plan 3 that his purposeS, instead of being eternal,
