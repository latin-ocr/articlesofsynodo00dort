administers to all, sufficiently and efficaciously, the neccs-
sary means to the revelation of Christ, saith and repentance.”
For, besides the experience of all ages, this is testified to
be false by the Scripture, (Psa. cxlvii. 19, 20‚) “He
showeth his words unto Jacob, his statutes and laws unto
Israel 3 he hath not done so unto any other people,
neither have they known his laws.’' (Acts xvi. 16.) “ God
permitted in past ages, all the nations to walk in their
own ways.'’ Acts xvi. 6, 7. “ They were forbidden

(Paul and his companions) by the Holy Ghost to preach

of Dort. “ The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that
he cannot turn or prepare himself, by his own natural strength and
good works, to saith and calling upon God.” “Works done before
the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant
to God, forasmuch as they spring not of saith in Jesus Christ; nei-
ther do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the school au-
thors say) deserve grace of congruity; yea, rather, for that they are
not done as God bath willed and commanded them to be done, we
doubt not but they have the nature of sin.'’ Art. x. xiii. Ch. of Eng.
