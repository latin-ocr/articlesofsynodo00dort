196 ARTIoLEs or THE

8. Who teach that “ God has not decreed from his
own mere just will, to leave any in the fall of Adam, and
in the common state of sin and damnation, or to pass them
by in the communication of grace necessary to saith and
conversion.'’ For that passage stands firm, “ He hath
mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will
he hardeneth.⁷' Rom. ix. 18. Also, “I glorify thee, Ο
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for that thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and hast re-
vealed them unto babes 3 even so, Father, for so it hath
pleased thee.'’ Matt. xi. 25, 26.

9. Who teach that “the reason why God sends the
gospel to one nation rather than another is not the mere
and sole good pleasure of God3 but because this nation is
better and. more deserving than that to which the gospel
is not communicated.'' Yet Moses recalls the people of
Israel from this, saying, “Behold the heavens and the
heaven of heavens is the Lord thy God’s 3 the earth also,
with all that therein is 3 only the Lord had a delight in
thy fathers to love them 3 and he chose their seed after
them, even yon, above al] people, as it is this day.” Deut.
x. 14, 15. And Christ, (ζ Woe unto thee, Chorazin!
VVoe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works that
are done in thee, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they

and unspeakable comfort to godly persons; and. such as feel in them-
selvee the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the
fiesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to
high and heavenly things; as well because it doth greatly establish
and confirm their saith of eterna] salvation, to be enjoyed through

Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God.”
Art. xvii. of the Church of England.
