had willed to confer equallyupon all men the benefits
which were acquired by the death of Christ3 and that
some rather than others (prce aliis) should be partakers
of the remission of sins and eternal life, this discrimina-
tion depended on their free will, applying to themselves
of the grace indifferently offered, not from an especial
gift of mercy operating effectually in them, that they,
rather than others, should apply to themselves this grace.
For these, while they pretend to propose to themselves
this distinction in a wholesome sense7 endeavour to give
the people a taste of the pernicious poison of pelagianisn1.>¹<

every person born into this world, deserveth God's wrath and damna-
tion. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe
and are baptized, yet the apostle doth confess that coneupiseenee and
lust hath of itself the nature of sin.’' Art. ix. Church of England.

“We believe that the disobedienee of Adam’s sin, which they eall
original (oriyim's), hath been spread abroad, and pourcd out upon
the whole human raee. But original sin is the corruption of the
whole nature, and hereditary vice, by which even infants themselves,
in the mothel-'s womb, are polluted3 and which, as a certain noxious
root, shoots forth (proyerminat) every kind of sins in man, and is so
base and execrable before God, that· it suffices for the condemnat-ion
of the whole human raee. Neither is it to be believed that it is en-
tirely extinguished or pulled up by the roots in baptism3 seeing that
from it, as from a corrupt fountain, perpetual streams and rivulets
continually arise and flow forth, though it does not fall out to con-
demnation, and is not imputed to the children of Go'd‚ but is remitted
to chem by the pure grace and merey of God; not that they should
fall asleep eonfiding in this remission‚ but that it should excite the
more frequent groans (gemitus) in the faithful, and that they should
more ardently desire to be freed from this body of death. Hence we
condemn the error of the Pelagians, who assert that original sin is
nothing but imitation.” Phil. ii. 13. John xv. 5. Psa. li. 7. Rom.
