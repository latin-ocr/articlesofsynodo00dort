PRECEDINGEVENTS. 71

in the churches, they entreated the most noble lords, the
Curators, that they would not expose the churches to
those perils, but rather would think of appointing another
proper person, who was free from this suspicion. And
they also admonished Utenbogardus to desist from this
recommendation 3 who, despising these admonitions, did
not desist from urging his (Arminius’s) vocation, until
at length he had attained the same.

His vocation having been thus appointed, the Classis
of Amsterdam refused to consent to his dismission3 es-
pecially for this reason, because the more prudent thought
that a disposition so greatly luxuriant, and prone to in-
novation, would be statedly employed, with moro evident
danger in an University, at which youth consecrated to
the ministry of the churches are educated, and where
greater liberty of teaching uses to be taken, than in any
particular church in which it may be restrained within
bounds‚ by the vigilance and authority of the presbytery.
His dismission was notwithstanding obtained, by the fre-
quent petitions of the lords, the Curators, of Utenbo-
gardus, and even of Arminius himself 3 yet upon this
condition, that a conference having been first held with
Dr. Francis GomarUS, concerning the principal heads of
doctrine, he should remove from himself all suspicion of
heterodoxy by an explicit (rotunda) declaration of his
opinion 3 when he had first promised, with a solemn at-
testation, that he would never disseminate his opinions,
if perhaps he had any singular ones* This conference

 

²* How far he fulfilled this solemn promise and attestation, not
only the following history, but even the histories of his most decided
advocates, fully show. In fact, hc fulfilled it in the very samo
manner that the subscriptions and most solemn engagement-s. of
numbers in our church at their ordination are fulfilled.
