posed? Were four divines an adequate representation of
all the Calviuists in England? Did not one or more of
all these four dissent from the decisione of this Synod?
Were other Protestant countries represented in any great
degree more adequately? lVere not the leading men
greatly embittered with personal enmities, and the spirit
of persecution and resentment? Did not politica] interests
and the spirit of party still more embitter the spirits, or
sway the deliberations and conclusions of the Synod?
And therefore are all the Calvinists who lived at that
time, or who now live, or whoever shall live, to be judged
according to the proceedings of the Synod of Dort‘? It
would be no difficult undertaking by such a procedure to
fix very heavy charges on the whole body of anti-Cal-
vinists in Europe and in the world 3 but attempts of this
kind prove nothing, except a disposition to act the part
of a special pleader in the controversy, rather than that
of an impartial judge. As I, however, had met with the
same abstract of the articles of this Synod in other pub-
lications more favourable to Calvinism, I had no suspicion
that these were not the real articles of the Synod, but an
abbreviation, (yet with several clauses also added) an ab- χ-
breviation by avowed opponents. But the Christian Ob-
server first excited a suspicion that these were not the
real articles of the Synod, and led me to inquire after a
copy of those articles, which are indeed immensely more
discordant with the abbreviations than I could have pre-
viously imagined. But let the attentive reader judge
from the following literal translation of these articleS, &c.
as contained in the Sylloqe Confessionum, Oxford, 1804.
