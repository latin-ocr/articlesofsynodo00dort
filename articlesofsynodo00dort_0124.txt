It therefore pleased the illustrious, the States‚ that
leaving these thorny questions, they should come to the
discussion of the articles. The pastors deputed by the
churches proposed in writing their reasons on account of
which they disapproved of each of these articles. The
Rcmonstrants also, on the other side, exhibited in writing

their own arguments, by which they thought that each of Ἰ

them might be confirmed. About these reasons and argu-
ments, disputations were held by speaking in the full
convention of the illustrious‚ the States. The parts of
the collocutor, in the name of those deputed by the
churches, were sustained by Festus Hommius 3 but in the
name of the Remonstrants, at first by Adrian Borrius‚ and
then by N icolas Grevinchovius‚ John Arnoldi, and Simon
Episcopius, succeeding each other by turns.

While the pastors were occupied in this conferenee,
Conradus Vorstius had returned out of Westphalia into
Holland, whom the illustriOUS‚ the States‚ appointed to be ¹
heard in a full convention, all the collocutors being present.
When they were come together, he made a prolix oration,
in which he endeavoured to clear himself from the errors
objected to him. Then the collocutors were asked whether
they had any considerations on account of which they
judged that the calling of Vorstius to the professorship
of theology in the University of Leyden should be
hindered. The Remonstrants expressly declared that
they had nothing against Vorsfflus, neither had they de-
tected any thing in his writings which was repugnant to
truth and piety.* The other pastors exhibited in writing

·>' “ Among the persecuted ecelesiasties was the famous Vorstius,
who by his religione sentiments, which differed but little from the
Socinian system, had rendered the Arminians particularly odious.”
