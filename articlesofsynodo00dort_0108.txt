102 HISTORY or

the order of handling the articles. For Arminius seemed
to place the great defence of his cause in this, that the
beginning should be made with the article of predesti-
nation. Gomarus thought, that because the article which
respected justification seemed more necessary, the begin-
nings should be made with it 3 which also pleased the
illustrious, the States.‘¹<

Concerning this article, there was the same controversy,
which had previously been agitated before the supreme
court, namely, whether saith, inasmuch as it is an act
according to the gracious estimation of God, be that
righteousness itself by which we are justified before God.
In the second place, it was treated concerning the doc-
trine of divine predestination, which Arminius endea-
voured to render odious by the same consequences, which
he had lately brought forward in the convention of the
illustrious, the States. But Gomarus urged the principa]
point, namely, Whether faith were the antecedent cause
or condition of election, or whether indeed the fruit or
effect of the same. The third controversy was concern-
ing the grace of God and free—will. Arminius professed
that 116 acknowledged all the operations of divine grace,
whatever could be assigned in the conversion of man;
only that no grace should be assigned, which is irresisti-
hle. Gomarus showcd what anibiguity and what guile
might be concealcd under that word irresistihle; namely,

* Arminius on this point showed his sound policy3 for when de-
clamations against predestination have prepared the way, a prejudice
as to the other doctrines connected with it, or held by those who
hold that offensive doctrine, will seldom be impartially considered.
Some modern refuters of Calvinism either have not been so politic, or
they have been more sair, in this respect, than Arminius was.
