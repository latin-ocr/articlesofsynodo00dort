INTRonnoronr ESSAY. 9

commended him to the Curators of the University‚ as a
candidate for the vacant Professorship. The leading Bel-
gio ministers, hearing of this recommendation, and deeply
apprehensive of the consequences of electing such a man
to so important a station, besought both Uytenbogart and
the Curators of the University to desist from all attempts
to place in such an office one who was the object of so
much suspicion. But these entreaties were disregarded.
The recommendation of him was prosecuted with undi-
minished zeal, and the Curators at length elected and
formally called him to the vacant chair.

The call being laid, as usual, before the Classis of Am-
sterdam, that body declined to put it into his hands.
They supposed that he was more likely to prove mischie-
vous in the office to which he was called than in his pas-
toral charge, where he was more immediately under the
supervision and restraint of his brethren in the ministry.
But, at length, at the repeated and earnest entreaties of

Uytenbogart, of the Curators, and of Arminius himself, ·

he was permitted to accept the call, and was regularly
dismissed from the Classis to enter on his new office.
This dismission, however, was granted upon the express
condition, that he should hold a conference with Gommus,
one of the theological Professors in the same University
with that to which he was called, and should remove
from himself all suspicion of heterodoxy, by a full and
candid declaration of his opinions in regard to the leading
doctrines of the Gospe13 and, moreover, the Classis ex-
acted from him a solemn promise, that if- it should be
found that he held any opinions different from the Belgio
Confession, he would refrain from disseminating them.
This 'conference was held in the presence of the Curators
