142 HISTORYOF

monstrants went on to press this their toleration by every
means, and to commend it privately and publiely in their
writings and sermons3 especially by this argument, that
the articles, eoneerning which the controversy was main-
tained, they said, were of so small importanse, that they
did not relate to the ground or fundamental points of sal-
vation 3 but in articles of this kind, toleration might and
ought to be established.

July 25, 1614] And thus they at length effeeted,
that a deeree concerning this toleration, some of the prin-
cipal and powerful eities of Holland and VVest Friesland
being unwilling and striving against it, should be pub-
lished in print, confirmed with certain testimonies of
Scripture and of the fathers (among whom they had also
brought forward Faustus Regiensiensis, the leader of the
Semi-Pelagians.) Against which things, when J ames
Triglandius, a pastor of the chureh at Amsterdam, had
answered in a publio writing‚ Utenbogardus also prolixly
attempted a defenee of this deeree. In this, he, by un-
worthy methods, tradueed and reviled, as well the doe-
trine of the Reformed churehes, as especially the lights
of the same, Calvin, Beza⁷ Zanehius, and others. To this
writing, Triglandius opposed an accurate answer, in de-
fenee of the honour, both of the doctrine and the dootors
of the Reformed ehurches. And when they (the Re-
monstrants) saw that the authority of this writing, to which
they had given the name of a deeree of the States, was

tious eonformists. This is simple, intelligible, and evidently reason-
able; but to tolerato exclusively opinions which do not relate to the
fundamental& of sali-atrion, or militate against them, must make way
for intricate and endless disputes and difficulties, about what are and

what are not the fundamentals of salvation3 what is tolerated, and
what is not tolerated.
