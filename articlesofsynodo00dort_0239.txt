(insidietur) for all, wounds very many, and fatally pierces
through many, as well with javelins of desperation as of
security. That the same doctrine makes God the author
of sin, unjust, a tyrant, a hypocrite 3 nor is it any other
than interpolated Stoicism‚ Manicheism‚ Libertinism‚ and
Turcism, (strez'smum.)* That it renders men secure, as
being persuaded that it does not hinder the salvation of
the elect, in what manner soever they live 3 and they can
with safety perpetrate the most atrocious crimes. That it
does not profit the reprobate, as to salvation‚ if they
should truly do all the works of the saints. That by the
same (doctrine) it is taught that God, by the bare and
mere determination (nudo puroque arbitrio) of his will,
without any respect (views intuitu) of the sin of any man,

* The chapter in the “Refutation of Calvinism,'’ showing “that
the earliest heretics maintained opinions greatly resembling the pe-
culiar tenets of Calvinism,'’ comes far short, it seems, of the charges
brought by the Remonstrants against the doctrine of predestination
as held by the Reformed churches, including that of England among
the rest. That doctrine, as held in these churches, was not only
Manicheism, but heathen Stoicism, infidel Libertinism‚ and Moham-
medism. But it is far more easy to bring accusatione, against any
tenet or body of men, than satisfactorily to prove them. The Synod
of Dort did not at all shrink from proelaiming that such charges had
been brought3 and they were satisfied, and on good ground, that they
had fully demonstrated them to be unfounded.
