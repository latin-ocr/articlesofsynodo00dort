the opposite party, while the very circumstances in

and especially the strict prohibition of printing or vending any other
account, in Latin, Dutch, or French, in the Federated provinces,
during seven yearS, without a special license for that purpose, did
not eventually conduco to this, may be a question. The measure,
however, was impolitic, if not unjustifiable.
