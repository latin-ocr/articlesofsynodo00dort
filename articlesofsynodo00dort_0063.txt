spirit, justification by saith alone, and even of the atone-
ment and Deity of Christ 3 and that the opponents of the
Synod of Dort, and the Remonstrants in general, were
far more favourable to Pelagians, nay, to Socinians, than to
Calvinists ; and were almost universally unsound, in what
are commonly called orthodox doctrines, and many of
them far from being conscientious in their conduct. In-
deed, it will appear undeniable, that the opposition made to
them by the Contra-Remonstrants‚ was much more de-

doctrine of persona] election‚ and the final perseverance
of true believers as connected with it.

5. The author purposed, also, by means of this publi-
cation, to leave behind him, in print, his deliberate judg-
ment on several controverted points, which must other-
wise have died with him, or have been published sepa-
rately, for which he had no inclination. But he has here
grafted them as notes or remarks on the several parts of
this work 3 and he trusts he has now done with all con-
troversy.

It is doubtless vain to attempt any thing, against many
of those opponents who succeed to each other, with suffi-
cient variety, as to the grounds on which they take their
stand, and from which they make the assault, but in
some respects nearly in the same course of misapprehen-
sion, or misrepresentation, as to the real sentiments of
those whom they undertake to refute. It suffices to say
of them, “ Neither can they prove the things of which
they accuse us ;'' and to say to them, “Thou shalt not
bear false witness against thy neighbour.’' But, indeed,
Calvinists seem to be no more considered as neiyhbours by
many Anti-Calvinists, than the Publicans, Samaritans,
and Gentiles, were by the Scribcs and Pharisecs.
