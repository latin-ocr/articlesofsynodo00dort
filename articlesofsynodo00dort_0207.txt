Art. II. Of the Merit and Effeci} of Olcrist’s Death.

“That J esus Christ hath not suffered death, but for
those elect only3 having neither any intent nor command-
ment from the Father‚ to make satisfaction for the sins
of the whole world.” (See Articles iv. v.)

REJEOTION' OF ERRORS ΟΝ THE SECOND CHAPTER.

The orthodox doctrine having been explained, the Synod
reJects the errors of those,

1. Who teach “ that Grod the Father destined his own
Son unto the death of the cross, without a certain and
definite counsel of saving any one by name (nominatim),
(Rev. xiii. 8 3 xvii. 8 5 xx. 15,) so that its own necessity,
utility, and meritoriousness (dz‘ynitas), might be estab-
lished unimpaired (sarta tecta) to the benefit obtained
(impetratz’oni) by the death of Christ, and be perfect in
its measures (numeris), and complete and entire, even if
the obtained redemption had not, in fact, been applied to
any individual.'' For this assertion is contumelious to the
wisdom of God and the merit of J esus Christ, and is con-
trary to Scripture, as the Saviour says, “ I lay down
my life for the sheep, and I know them.'’ John x. 15, 27.
And the prophet Isaiah, concerning the Saviour, “ When
he shall give himself a sacrifice for sin, he shall 566 his
seed, he shall prolong his days, and the will of J EHOVAH
shall prosper in his hand.'' Isa. liii. 10. And finally, it

overturns the article of faith by which we “believe the
church.'‘'*

ὕ For in this case there might possibly have been no “ Church of
God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.’' Acts XX. 28.
