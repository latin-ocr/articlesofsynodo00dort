on a fair interpretation of the sacred oracles, and so power-

General counciIS, so called, convened by the concurring
authority of many princes and rulers, over rival nations,
are not likely to come to any such scriptural decisions 3

bers of the establishment, in this land, at least, must be
allowed to think that this was the case, in the framing
of our articles, liturgy, and homilies.

language at least of genuine piety, declare the awful obliga-
