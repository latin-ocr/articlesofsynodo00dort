58 PREFACE.

After all that has been published on these subjeets,
the groundless charges brought: b‘y many against the whole
body, cannot be considered as exeusable misapprehension.
They must be either intentional misrepresentati0n‚ or the
inexcusable presumption of writing on subjeets which the
writers have never studied‚ and against persons, and de-
scriptions of persons, of whose tenets, amidst most abun-
dant means of information‚ they remain wilfully ignorant.
A fair and impartial opponent, is entitled to respect, but
I can only Pity such controversialists.

THOMAS SCOTT.
ASTON SANFORD‚ March 15, 1818
