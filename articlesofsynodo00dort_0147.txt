pmcn-mne Evnnrs. 141

On this occasion, the Remonstrants exulted after a
wonderful manner, and hoping that they might now be-
come possessed of their wish, they laboured by their ad-
vocate, that a certain formula of a toleration (the same
indeed which is contained in the fourth and fifth articles
of the second chapter of the ecclesiastical governmcnt of
Utrecht,) should be confirmed by the authority of the
illustrious‚ the States‚ and commanded to the churches.
Though the minds of many in the convention of the States
were inclined to this, yet the more prudent strenuously
opposed it, thinking it to be unjust to command (au-

discordant opinions.'' The ground of the toleration here stated, like-
wise, is widely different from that which is at present insisted ους
namely, thatin matters of conscience towards God, no human au-
thority has a right to interfere, provided nothing be avowed or done
which threatcns or disturbs the peace of the cominunity; and that
human authority can make only hypocrites, not willing and conscion-
