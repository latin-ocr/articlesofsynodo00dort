their own direct authority, but “the apostles and elders
came together for to consider of this matter.” Acts xv. 6.
It is evident that some, even in “ that first qeneral coun-
cil,'’ as it is very improperly called, had strong prejudices
against the measure which was finally decided on 3 yet its
decrees proved a blessing of no small magnitude to the
churches of Christ, whether constituted of J ewish or Gen·

in» itself, though General Councils and Synods should have
in many or most instances been productive of far greater
evil than good. The fault lay in the motives, the corrupt
passions and wrong state of mind and heart of those who
convened, and of those who constituted them, (that is, in.
the abuse of the thing,) not in the thing itself.

The apostles by their own authority might have decreed
the same things, and have said, “It seemed good to the
Holy Ghost and to us, &c. ;'’ but they were not led by the
Spirit of inspiration to adopt this method 3 they did
nothing by absolute authority 3 it does not appear that
any thing directly miraculous, or of immediate revelation,

hypocrisy,’' might have formed, under the mere ordinary
teaching and superintendence of the same Spirit. Now,
it is not impossible for God to raise up elders and teaehers,
bearing this holy character, and endued with this heavenly
wisdoin, in other ages and nations, who, coming together
to consider of those things which corrupt the doctrine,
worship, and purity, or disturb the peace, of the church,
