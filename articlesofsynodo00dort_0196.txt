are all things 5 10 whom be glory‚ for ever. Amen.'’'¹<

from saving grace 611 1116 1661 of mankind, and appointed
them by 1116 same deeree to eternal damnation, without
any regard to their infidelity and impeniteney.'’

Nothing is said of the children of unbelievers dying in infaney, and
the Scripture says nothing. But why might not these Calvinists have
as favourable a hope of all infants dying before actual sin as anti-
Calvinists can have ἰ)
