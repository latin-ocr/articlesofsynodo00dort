equalled by those of any other uninspired ecclesiastical
body that ever convened. Yet the Synod of Dort had,

and altogether pre-eminent. It was not merely a meet-

ions of Arminius, which were then agitating so many
minds, could be reconciled with the Confession of the
Belgio Churches.

The opinions denominated Arminian had been sub-
