SYNon or Donr. 179

prescribe terms of communion, or of officiating as ministers
on those who desire voluntari& to join them, and exclude
such as decline compliance.

How far the revenues in the Belgio churches could with
any propriety have been shared‚ and any portion of them
allotted to what we might call the dissenting teachers, I
am not prepared to say. But as toleration (in this sense
at least) was no part of the system at the Reformation
in any country, the ancient revenues for religious purposes‚
as far as they were preserved for those uses, of course were
allotted to the established ministers in the different
churches. N either (ἶίεεεηίενε, nor provi-sion for dissenters‚
were thought of, and it would afterwards have been ex-
pecting too much in general, to suppose that they
who found themselves in possession of these revenues
would voluntarily share them with the dissentients, or
that rulers would venture to compel them. Yet, if to a
full toleration something had publicly been allotted towards
the support ofpeacefal and conscientious dissenting teach-

⁸ ers, it would, as it appears to me, at least have had a.

most powerful effect in diminishing acrimony, silencing
objections, and promoting peace and love.
