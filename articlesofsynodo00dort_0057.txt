The famous Lambeth Articles, drawn up in 1595,
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, are acknowledged
by all who ever read them, to be among the most strongly
marked Calvinistical compositions that ever were penned.
They were drawn up by Archbishop Whitgift‚ then at
the head of the English Established Church, and one of
its most conspicuous divines and fathers. The archbishop
was assisted in this service by the bishops of London and
Bangor, and by some others. After receiving the public
approbation of these dignitaries, the Articles were sent
to the Archbishop of York, and the Bishop of Rochester,
who also subscribed them. Thus ratified, Archbishop
Whitgift sent them to the University of Cambridge, with
a letter, in which he declared—“ That these Artieles were
not to be considered as laws and decreeS, but as proposi-
tions which he and his brethren were persuaded were
true, and corresponding with the doctrine professed in
the Chureh of England, and established by the laws of
the land.'’ Nor is this all: it having been suggested by
some, that the Archbishop agreed to these Articles rather
for the sake of peace, than because he believed them,
Strype, his Episcopal biographer, repels the charge with
indignation, declaring that such an insinuation is as false
as it is mean and disparaging to 1116 p1·imate.³³<

Not long after the delegates to the Synod of Dort, from
the Church of England, returned home, they were at-
tacked by certain writers, who reproached them for having
signed the Articles of the Synod, and charged them with
having, by that act, given countenance to error, and also
with having departed from the Articles of their own
