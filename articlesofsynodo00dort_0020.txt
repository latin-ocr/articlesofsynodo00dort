14 INTRODUOTORY EssAY.

At length, after various attempts to bring Arminius to
an avowal of his real opinions had failed, he was sum-
moned by the States General, in 1609, to a conferenee at
the Hague. He went, attended by several of his friends,
and. met Gomarus, aeeompanied with a corresponding
number of orthodox divines. Here again the sinister
designs and artful management of Arminius and his oom-
panions were manifested, but overruled, and he was oon-
strained, to a considerable extent, to explain and defend.
himself. But before this oonference was terminated, the
agitation of his mind seems to have preyed upon his
bodily health. He was first taken apparently in a small

warm friend and panegyrist—“He was sometimes heard,
in the course of his last illness, to groan and sigh, and to
cry out, ‘Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne
me a man of strife, and a man of eontention to the whole
earth. I have lent to no man on usury, nor have men
lent to me on usury 3 yet every one doth ourse me 1’ '’
Attempts have been made to show that Arminius did,
in fact, differ very little from the reeeived doctrines of the
Belgio ohurohes 3 nay, that he, on the whole, coincided
with sublapsarian Calvinists 3 and of course, was most un-
justly aeeused of embraoing the heresy since called by his
name. It is evident that Dr. Mosheim, himself an Ar-
minian, was not of this opinion. He plainly thought,
that the friends of the Belgio confession had 11111611 more
