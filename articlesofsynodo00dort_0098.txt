feared lest, in a short time, one· province should be en-
gaged in contest against another, church against abui-ch,
state against state, and citizens against each other. But
the illustrious, the States, determined that the writings
sealcd on each side in this conference should be preserved
in the supreme court, even unto a national Synod, neither
should they be communicated in the meanwhile to any
man (cuiquam mortalium). Yet neither did this con-
ference deliver from anxiety the churches, but rather in-
creased it 3 especially as the things which had been done
at it were concealed from the churches, For not without
reason (haud temere), they judged that this was done in
favour of Arminius, lest his opinions should be made mani-
fest. In the meanwhile the churches did not cease, by
their deputies, strenuously to petition the illustrious States,
that this ecclesiastical cause, which, except with* great
danger of the church, could not be deferred, might be ex-
amined and decided on, as soon as possible, by the judg-
ment either of a lawful provincial, or a national Synod.
When Arminius understood this, he procured by Utenbo-
gardus, whose authority at that time was great among
most of the chief persons of the country, that the illus-
trious States should command, that the annual Synods
themselves, as well of South as of North Holland, the time
of which was at hand, should be deferred. But as this
could not be done without the greatest detriment of the
churches, they again, having explained before the illus-
trious‚ the States‚ their difficulties, petitioned, either that it
might be allowed to hold, according to custom, each of the
annual Synods, as well thatin South as in North Holland ;
or that out of each united together one provincial Synod
should as soon as possible be called, as it had also before
this been petitioned.
