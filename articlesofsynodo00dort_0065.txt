INTRODUCTION TO THIS PREFACE.

BY THE TRANSLATOR·

IN perusing this preface‚ and the history contained in
it, the reader should especially recollect‚ that it was
drawn up and published by the authority and with the
sanction of the States General, and the Prince of Orzmge,
as well as by that of the Synod itself3 and that, in every
part of it, the acts, or public records in which the events
recorded were registered‚ are referred to, with the exact
dates of each transaction. No history can therefore be
attested as authentic‚ in a more satisfactory and unex-
ceptionable manner3 for whatever degree of colouring,
prejudices or partiality may be supposed to have given to
the narration, it can hardly be conceived‚ that collective
bodies, and individuals filling up such conspicuous and
exalted stations, would expressly attest any thing dz'rectly
false ; and then appeal to authorities, by which the false-

hood of their statement might at any time be dctected
