156 HISTORY or

In the mean while that most illustrious person, Dudley
Cal-leton, in the convention of the States General, publicly
complained that the honour of his master, the King of
Great Britain, had been very unworthily and impudently
reviled in the infamous libel (or pamphlet) Bilancz's,
which the Remonstrants, even after the edict of their
Highnesses, had taken care should be printed again, having
been translated into the French languagej, and having
briefly and solidly refuted most of the objections of the
Remonstrants‚ he explained to the States General what
method the King of Great Britain was accustomed to
employ in settling controversies concerning religion or

the States General, it more and more confirmed their
Highnesses in this holy determination. The Magistracy
also of the city of Amsterdam, having communicated
counsel previously with the pastors of that chureh, and
others called together for this cause, propounded in writing
many and very weighty reasons, in the convention of the
States of Holland and West Friesland, in which it was

method‚ than by a national Synod; at the same time
they most solidly answered all the objections of the Re-
monstrants, and all their projects concerning a. provincial
Synod, and also concerning a general council. Soon after,
likewise‚ the Magistracy of the city of Enokhuysen‚ having
exhibited many reasons in writing also, approved the
same. These reasons were afterwards made public, that

evasion to escape the trial, which can be suggested by his solicitor οι·
