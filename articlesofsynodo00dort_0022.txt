16 INTRODUOTORY EssAY.

and 301. To such a conclusion the learned Professor is
led principally, by an artful and imposing statement made
by Arminius to the magistrates·of Holland, in the year
1608, one year before his death, on which Mr. Stuart
puts the most favourable construction the words will
bear. But from a careful comparison of this declaration
of Arminius, with the original five articles of the Armin-
ian creed, (which were drawn up almost in the very words
of Arminius, so early as the year 1610, and exhibited by
the Remonstrants in the eonference at the Hague, in
1611 3 and were afterwards, together with a full explana-

tion and vindication of each article, laid before the Synod ,

of Dort‚ in 1617, changing, however, the dubitation of
the fifth article into a positive denial of the saints perse-
verance,) it will, I think, appear manifest, that Arminius
himself actually differed from the orthodox of that day,
on all the five points3 and that he agreed substantially
with the Remonstrants on all those doctrines for which
they were condemned in the Synod of Dort‚ And that
such was the fact, appears to have been assumed without
hesitation by the principal writers of that and the follow-
ing age, both Remonstrants and Contra-remonstrants.'’³¹<

It was fondly hoped by many that when Arminius
died, the controversy to which his speculations had given
rise, would have died and been buried with him. But
this, unhappily, by no means, proved to be the case. It
soon appeared that a number of Belgio divines of no
small name had embraced his sentiments, and could by
110 means be persuaded to desist from propagating them 3
and in 1610 they were organized into a body, or formal
