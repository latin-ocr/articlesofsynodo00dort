ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DOCTRINE OF THE DEATH OF CER-181¹, AND THROUGH 1'1' THE
REDEMPTION OF ΜΕΝ.

1. God is not only supremely merciful, but also su-
premely just. And his justice requires, (according as 116
hath revealed himself in the word,) that our sins com-
mitted aga-inst his infinite majesty, should be punished
not only with temporal, but also with eternal sufferings—
of soul as well as of body, which punishment we cannot
escape, unless the justice of God be satisfied. Isa. xlv. 21.
Rom. 111. 25, 26.

2. But as we cannot satisfy it, and deliver ourselves
from the wrath of God, God of infinite mercy gave to us
his only begotten Son as a surety, who, that he might
make satisfaction for us, was made sin and a curse on the
cross for us, or in our stead.>¹<

3. This death of the Son of God is a single and most
perfect sacrifice and satisfaction sor sins, of infinite value
ancl price, abundantly sufficient to expiate the sins of the
whole world.†
