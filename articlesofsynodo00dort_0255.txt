sYNOD or Don'r. 249

When the toachers of congregations and of schools,
supported by the revenues of the churches in Belgium,
had been excluded or suspended from their office and its
emolument, all that was donc in accession, seems to have
been unjustifiable. The excluded party, in reason, and
according to the Scripture, (though not according to the
general sentiments of that age,) were entitled to full tol-
eration, to worship God, and instruct others either as
preachers or teachers of schools, not supported by the
establishment, provided they did this peaceably. At
most, only very general restrictions should have been re-
quired. But such teachers of separate congregations, and
of schools, were not then known, or at least not recog-
nized 3 nearly all places of worship and schools were in
the hands of the established authorities, and every thing
attempted must be done secretly, and then, on that very
ground, condemned as a conventicle or seditious meeting.

Excommunication, according to Scripture, is nothing
more than simple exclusion from the communion of the
church : “let him be as an heathen man, and a publican :”
except when God miracvdously by his apostles‚ who could,
in that respect, “ do nothing against the truth, but for the
truth,'’ infiicted salutary chastisements, “ for the destruc-
tion of the fiesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day
of the Lord J esus ;'' or that “ others might learn not to
blaspheme.’' But when, in addition to such an exclusion‚

ment for building churehes or ehapels exclusively for the establish-
ment, while the public at large must advance the money from the
general tax or taxes, is thus consistent with striet equity. The de-
sign is excellent and most desirable; but whether it would not be
more unexoeptionahle if a proportionable sum were granted to peace-
able dissenters, for the building or repairing theIr places of worship,
may be mattenof inquiry to impartial legislators.
