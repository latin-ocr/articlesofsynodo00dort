hcart, peace of conscience, earnest desire (studium) of
filial obedience‚ glorying in God through Christ, yct
neverthclcss use the means by which God has promised
to work these things in us, ought not to be alarmcd by
the mention of reprobation, nor reckon themselves to be
reprobate3 but to use diligently the means of grace, and
ardently to desire, and reverently and humbly tc expect,
the period of more abounding (or fructifying, aberium)
grace. And much less should those persons bc terrificd

verted to God, simply desire to please him, and to be
delivered from the body of death, yet cannot attain to
what they wish in the path of saith and piety, because
the merciful God hath promised that he will not “ quench
the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed.”'⁸< But
this doctrine is justly for a terror to those who, forgetful
of Grod and the Saviour Jesus Christ, have delivered
themselves wholly to the cares and carnal pleasures of
the world, so long as they are not in earnest (serio) con-
verted unto God.

his word, which testifies that the children of believers

gracious covenant, in which they are comprehended along
with their parents, pious parents ought not to doubt of
the election and salvation of their children, whom God
hath called in infancy out of this life.†

they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture, and that will of
God is to be followed which we have expressly declared to us in the
word of· God.''—Art. xvii. Church of England. John vi. 37—40.

† The salvation of the offspring of believers, dying in infancy‚ is
here scripturally stated, and not limited to such as are baptized.
