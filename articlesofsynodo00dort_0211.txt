*SYNOD or nontin 205

7. Who teach that “ Christ neither could nor ought to
die, neither did he die, for those whom God especially
(summe) loved and chose to eternal life, when to such
there was no need of the death of Christ.'’ For they con-
tradict the apostle‚ saying, “ Christ loved me, and gave
himself for me.” Gal. ii. 20. Also, “ Who can lay any
thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justi-
fieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ who
died” (Rom. viii. 32, 34), doubtless for them. And the
Saviour who declared, ‘⁴ I lay down my life for my sheep.''
John x. 15. And, “This is my command, that ye love
one another, as I have loved you 3 greater love hath no
man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'’
John xv. 12, 13.

1. Man, from the beginning, was created in the image
of God, adorned in his mind, with the true and saving
knowledge of his Creator, and of spiritual things, with
righteousness in his will and heart, and purity in all his
affections, and thus was altogether holy 3 but by the in·
stigation of the devil and his own free will (libera sua
voluntate), revolting from God, he bereaved himself of

unto us true saith, that we may attain to the true knowledge of this
so great a mystery3 which saith embraces J esus Christ, with all his
merits‚ and claims it to itself, as its proper effect, and seeks thence-
forth nothing beyond him.'’ Belgio Confession‚ Art. xxii.
