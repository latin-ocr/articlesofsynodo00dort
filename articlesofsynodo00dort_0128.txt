While these things were doing, certain students of
sacred theology‚ who likewise had come forth from the
instruction and the house of Vorsfflus, in the University
of Franeker, which they had now been sedulously em-

print a certain little book of Faustus Socinus‚ concerning
the duty of a Christian man, in which persuasions are
given, that all who would consult the salvation of their

425, 426.) Though the Ebionites believed the celestial mission of
Christ, and his participation of a divine nature, yet they regarded
him as a man born of Joseph and Mary, according to the ordinary
course of nature.'’—(Ibid. vol. i. pp. 214, 215.)
