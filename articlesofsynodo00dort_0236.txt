230 ARTIOLES OF THE

true believers in this life, and the doubting of the papists
(pontzflciorum) brought back into the church. But the
holy Scripture every where requires this certainty, not
from special and extraordinary revelation, but from the
peculiar marks of the children of God, and the most con-
stant promises of God. In the first place, the apostle
Paul, (Rom. viii. 39,) “No created thing can separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ J esus our Lord,”
and 1 John iii. 24, “ Whoso keepeth his commandment

his own assurance of salvation to special revelation, or to any thing
different from what he exhorts others to, in order to obtain and retain
the same assurance. This concludes at least as strongly aga-inst those
who ground their assurance on dreams, visions, and impressions of
whatever kind, as those who say it can only bc enjoyed by immediate
revelation.
