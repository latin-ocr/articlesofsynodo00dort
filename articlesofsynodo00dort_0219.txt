SYNon or Dour. 213

In which manner, (or for which 1·cason,) unless the
admirable Author of all good should work in us, there
could be no hope to man of rising from the fall, by that
free will, by which when standing he fcll into ruin.*

17. But in the same manner as the omnipotent opera-
tion of G0d‚ whereby he produces and supports our natu-
ral life, doth not exclude, but require the use of means,
by which God in his infinite wisdom and goodness sees
fit to exercise this his power, so this fore-mentioned
supernatural power of God, by which he regenerates us,
in no wise excludes or sets aside the use of the gospel,
which the most wise God hath ordained as· the seed of
regeneration and the food of the soul. WVhereforQ as the
apostles, and those teachers who followed them, have
piously instructed the people concerning this grace of
God, in order to his glory and to the keeping down of all
pride 3 in the meantime, neither have they neglected
(being admonished by the holy gospel) to keep them
under the exercise of the word, the sacraments, and disci-
pline : so then be it far from us, that teachers or learners
in the church should presume to tempt God, by sepa·
rating those things, which God, of his own good pleasure‚
would have most closely united together. For grace is
conferred through admonitions, and the more promptly
we do our duty, the more illustrious the benefit of God,
who worketh in us, is wont to be, and the most rightly
doth his work proceed. To whom alone all the glory,

ἕ Α more lucid and scriptural exposition of the efficacious influ-
ence, by which the regenerating, life-giving, illuminating grace of
ο the Holjr spirit draws, teaches, and inclines the beart to willing
and sweet submission and obedience, can hardly be produced from
any writer. 2 Cor. x. 5.
