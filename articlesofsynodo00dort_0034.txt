28 INTRonuc'ronY EssAY.

properly, reminded him that they had not convened for
the purpose of trying the Confession of Faith of the Bel-
gic Churches, which had been long established and well
known 3 but that, as the Remonstrants were accuscd of
departing from the Reformed faith, they were bound first
το jusm'fiy themselveS, by giving Scriptura] proof in support
of their opinions.

To this plan of procedure they would by no means sub-
mit. It disconcerted their whole scheme , but the Synod
firmly refused to adopt any other plan. This refusal, of
course, shut the Remonstrants out from taking any part
in the deliberations of the body. Day after day they were
reasoned with, and urged to submit 10 a course of pro-
ceeding ecclesiastically regular, and adapted to their sit-
uation, but without success. They were, therefore, com-
pelled to withdraw. Upon their departure, the Synod
proceeded without them.

The language of the President (Bogerman) in dis-
missing the Remonstrants was rough, and adapted 10 give
pain. He pointedly charged them with fraudulent pro-
ceedings, with disingenuous actS, with falsehood, 816. For
this language, however, he alone was responsible. It had
not been dictated or authorized by the Synod. And a
number of the members, we are assured, heard it with
regret, and expressed their disapprobation of it. (Hales's
Works, Vol. iii. p. 123) And yet, while this language
was severe, and for an ecclesiastical assembly unseemly,
was it not substantially according to truth?

The Synod does not appear to have accomplished its
work by referring different portions of it to different com-
mittees 3 but the plan adopted was 10 request the divines

from each country represented in the Synod 1ο consult
