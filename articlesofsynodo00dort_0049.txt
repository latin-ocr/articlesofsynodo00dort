INTRonucTORY EssAY. 43

How unsearchable arc his judqments, and his ways are
past findiny out. All Christians ought to find herc a
definite sentence, a judgment final, and without appeal
in the dispute about grace. Or rather, they should learn
from this conduct of St. Paul, never to dispute about
predestinaffion, and immediately to oppose this bar against
all the subtleties of human wit, whether they arise of
themselveS, in meditating on this great subject, or whether
others suggest them. The best and the shortest way is,
early to oppose this strong bank against the inundations
of reasoning, and to consider this definitive sentence of
St. Paul as a rock immovable in the midst of the waves,
against which the proudest billows may beat in vain.
They may foam and dash, but are only broken against
them. All arrows darted against this shield, will have
the same fate as that of Priam.’'

Further on the same writer says :—“ To a system full
of great difficulties, Arminius has substituted another
system, which, to speak truly, involves no less difficulties
than the former. One may say of his doctrine what I
have observed of the innovations of Saumur. It is better
connected and less forced than the opinions of Mr.
Amyraut3 but, after all, it is but a palliative remedy,
for the Arminians have scarcely been able to answer
some objections which, as they pretend, cannot be refuted
upon Calvin's system. Resides, they find themselves
exposed to other difficulties which they cannot get over
but by an ingenuous confession of the weakness of human
reason, and the consideration of the incomprehensible
infinity of God. And was it worth while to contradict
Calvin for this? Why was Arminius so very difficult at
first, when at last he was obliged to fly to this asylum ⁴?
