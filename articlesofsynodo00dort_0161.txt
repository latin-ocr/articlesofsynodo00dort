sonable to think of a provincial Synod, for the composing
of these controversics. Because, in like manner, as it bc-
hovcd particular Synods in each of the provinces, to pre-
cede the national Synod, so in Holland also, both North
and South (Holland), particular Synods would precede.
Yet the Remonstrants, by their favourers, pressed eagerly
and urged such a Synod: either because they thought
that it would less obstruet their cause, as they had in Hol-

or that they might by this tergiversation absolutely hinder
the calling of the national Synod. But when they them-

churches would be present at the same. If they should
account themselves aggrieved by the judgment of such a
Synod, it would always be entire and lawful to them to
appeal from this national to a general counoil, provided
only, that in the meantime they obeyed the judgment of
the national Synod. By these evasions and subterfuges
they effected that the letters of convocation were for some
little time delayed 5 and it was necessary that the day ap-

resembled that of an aecused person who, instead of demanding a fair
trial, objects to the authority of the court, challenges the jux-ymen,
