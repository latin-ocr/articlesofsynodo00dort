PRECEDING EVENTS. 121

were to be admonished‚ as well by letters (the catalogue of
his errors being also transmitted‚) as by his own ambassa-
dor, an illustrious person, D. Rodolphus Winwood‚ not to
admit a man infamous by so many and so great errors and
blasphemias, to the public office of tcaching in tho Uni-
versity3 but rather to banish him from their bordch‚
lest if the youth should be imbued by him with these
wickcd and exeorable errors, the state should by little and
little go to decay; soeing that by the purity of the Re-
formed doctrine, in which the Belgio ohurohes had
hitherto cultivated an amicable agreement with the
English, and in the preservation of it, the safety of the
republie itself was oonoerned.>¹< When this was delayed,
the Remonstrants earnestly striving against it, and espe-
cially Vorstius‚ by various explanations, apologieS, pro-
logues (prodromz'3‚) and answers, as well modest, as more
fully excusing and strengthening (incrustante) his own
errors 3 yet his most Serene Royal Majesty did not desist
to urge his dismission‚ sometimes repeating his admoni-
tions‚ and even adding a serious protestation.†

 

 

ξ This at least shows the general judgment of theologians concern-
ing Vorstius‚ whom the Remonstrants so zealously supported; aud
even still more strongly, on the supposition that James and his select
divines were not at that time favourable to Calvinism.

†This shows that the generally received doctrine of t-he church
of England was then supposed to be, viz. for substance tho same as
that of the Belgio church. The eulogium on James Ι. reminds us
of the words of Cowper, “Grant me discernment, Ι allow it you :''
yet the English divines have spoken still more decidedly on the sub-
ject. (Presace to 'translation of the Bible.) It may be supposed,
that the Belgio divinos who adhered to the Synod of Dort, would re--
tract or qualify this eulogium, when they learned the change which
soon after took place in England under the patr-onage of tho same

JameS.
