PRECEDING EVEN'rs. 151

But when the Remonstrants saw that the convoking
of a national Synod was recommended with so great
earnestness by kings and princes, and the neighbouring
and federated republics, yea, and also by the principal
citics of Holland and West Fricsla-nd, and when they
searcd lest the States of Holland and West Friesland, of
whom many of their own accord inclined to it, and pro-
moted this business diligently, should at length be moved
to this consent, and so, that at some time, an account
must be rendered of their doctrine and actions before the
ecclesiastical tribunals, in order to avoid this, they at
first proposed a new way of settling the controversieS,
namely, that a few persons, both political and ecclesias-
tical, of a certain and equal number, should be chosen by
the States of Holland and West Friesland, who, having
communicated counsels with each other, might devise
some method of peace and concord, which having been
approved by the States, might then be prescribed to the
churches. But when this did not succeed, (because the
more prudent easily foresaw from whom, and of what
kind of persons this convention would be constituted, and
what was to be expected from it 3 and besides, that it
was unprecedented in the churches, and very little su'ited
for taking away ecclesiastical controversies in things per-
taining to doctrine,) they thought that the most extreme
measures must be tried, rather than be reduced to this
necessity 3 and accordingly recourse was had to the most

ample ofChristians in every age, but enjoined byGod himself. How
far they were warranted in this sentiment, constitutes a distinct ques-
tion. The Synod of Dort, however, should not be judged by our
modern opinions, but by the general opinion of that age. The reasons
why the Remonstrants dissented from that opinion are very evident.
