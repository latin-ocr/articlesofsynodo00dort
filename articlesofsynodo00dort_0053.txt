we are elected, wc shall bc saved, do what we will 3 and
if not elected, we shall be lost, do what wc can. But is
it not perfectly evident that the objection here lies with
quite as much force against the Arminian or Pelagian
hypothesis? Arminians and Pelagians both grant that
all men will not actually be saved 5 that the salvation or
perdition of each individual is distinctly foreknown by
G0d; and that the event will certainly happen as hc
foresees that it will. May not a caviller, then, say, with
quite as much appearance of justice in this case as in
the other, “The result, as to my salvation, though un-
known to me, is known to God, and certain. If I ain to
be saved, no anxiety about it is necessary 3 and if I am
to pel-ish, all anxiety about it would be useless.'' But
would an Arminian consider such an objection as valid
against his creed? Probably not. Yet it is certainly
just as va-lid against his creed as against ours. The
truth is, the Arminian, by resorting to his scheme, does
not really get rid of one particle of the difficulty which
he alleges against the Calvinistic system: he only places
it one step further back, but must meet it in its full
strength after all. Until we can bring ourselves to
swallow the monstrous absurdity, that what is to be, will
not be, that what God foresees as certain, may never
happen, the cavil, such as it is, remains unanswered. If
there be a God who is endowed with perfect foreknow-
lcdge, and who is, and always has been, acting upon a
plan, of which he knows the end from the beginning—-
and there is such a Being, or there is no God 3—then all
the difficulty which lies against the doctrine of sovercign,
unconditional prcdetermination, lies equally, and in all its
unmitigated force, against the doctrine of foreknowledge
