whole history, it appears, that no other form of govern-
ment was proposed even by the Remonstrants, nor any
thing mentioned about toleration in that respect ; though
their measures evidently tended to subvert the whole sys-

Presbytcrian model, and all academical honours and dis-
tinctions were conferred in that line.

This, beyond doubt, having been the case, and the
principa] persons concerned in the controversy against
the Remonstrants, having been zealouslgs, and (most of
them at least) conscientibus-ly attached to this system3 so
that it appeared to them as if the very interest of vital
religion was intimately, if not inseparably, connected with
it; he must, I say, be a most unrea‘sonable and partial

stamp, that they would permit their whole system, and
all its operations, to be retarded, disturbed, nay, totally
derangcd and subverted, and the whole state of their
churches thrown into confusion and anarchy, without
vigorous struggles to prevent a catastrophe in their view
so deplorable and ruinous. Even in this age and land,
few persons, of supposed candour and liberality of mind,

reach. Indeed, it is not in human nature, and cannot
reasonably be expected. Nor, till men are convinced
that it is not the cause of God, nor essential to that of
true religion, would it be right thus to yield it up to their
