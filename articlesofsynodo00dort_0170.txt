examined, some of them were suspended from their office,
and others wholly set aside. But as to those who, because
of the shortness of the time, having been cited, could not
be heard, and those who having been cited, had not ap-
peared, five pastors were deputed, to whom the States
joined also three deputies who might take cognizance of
their cause, and give sentence upon it in the name of the
Synod. But it was expressly enjoined on these deputies
not to fix any censure on any one, because of the opinion
expressed in the five articles of the Remonstrants, for-
asmuch as the judgment concerning the same had been
reserved entire to the national Synod. But they, though
they every where on the aforementioned most weighty
causes, even during the national Synod, suspended many,
partly from the office of teaching, and partly entirely set
them aside 3 yet marked no one with any censure because
of the opinion of the five articles, as it may be evidently
shown from their very Acts* In North Holland matters
were conducted after the same method, in the Synod of
Horn, in which the pastors of Horn, John Valesius,
John Rodingenus, and Isaac Welsingius, having been
suspended from the office of teaching, appealed to the na-
tional Synod. And when the deputies of this Synod, along
with the delegates of the StateS, examined, in the Classis
of Alcmar, the cause of John Geystran, a pastor of Alc-
mar, and of Peter Geystran, his brother, a pastor of Eg-
mond, it was discovered that they had been evidently ad-
dicted to the blasphemous and execrable errors of Socinus,

ἥὲ The appeal is thus made to the registered Acts of these deputies,
evidently because they had been or were likely to be misrepresented
by the favourers of the Remonstrants3 as, beyond doubt, they gene-

rally have been to this very day.
