the system itself, as held by its advocates, thther this
arises from the want of knowledge, or the want of can-
dour, is not for me to decide3 but the effect is the same,
and the conduct worthy of severe censure. How many

of what the system, as held by Calvinists‚ really is.

The enemies of the system allege, that it represents
