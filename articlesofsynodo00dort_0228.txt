222 ARTIOLES 01· THE

faithful (vere fideles) in grace, and preserving them, is
greater than what can be overcome by the flesh 3 yet the
converted are not always so influenced and moved by
God, that they cannot depart, in certain particular actions,
from the leading of grace, and be seduced by the desires
(concupiscentiis) of the flesh, and obey them. Where-
fore, they must continually watch and pray, lest they
should be led into temptations. Which, when they do
not, they may be not only violently carried away by the
flesh, and the world, and Satan, 111110 grievous and atro-
cious sins3 but they are sometimes even thus violently
carried away by the righteous permission of God, which
the mournful falls of David and Peter, and of other saints
recorded in Scripture, demonstrate*

5. But by such enormous sins they exceedingly offend
God3 they incur the guilt of death, they grieve the Holy
Spirit, they interrupt the exercise of faith, they most
grievously wound conscience, and they sometimes lose,
for a time, the perception of grace, until by serious re-
pentance returning into the way, the paterna] counte·
nance of Grod again shines upon them. (Psa. li. 11, 12.)

6. For God, who is rich in mercy, from his immutable
purpose of election, does not wholly take away his Holy
Spirit from his own, even in lamentable falls, nor does
he so permit them to glide down (prolabi,) that they
should fall from the grace of adoption and the state of
justification, or commit the sin unto death, or against the
Holy Spirit, that, being deserted by him, they should
cast themselves headlong into eternal destruction.†
