7. Grod revealed this mystery of his own will to fewer
persons under the Old Testament 3 but now, the distinc-
tion of people being taken away, he manifests it to more.
The cause of which dispensation is not to be ascribed to
the dignity (or worthiness) of one nation above another,
or to the better use of the light of nature, but to the most
free good pleasure and gratuitous love of God. Therefore
they to whom, beyond and contrary to all merit, such
grace is given (fit), ought to acknowledge it with an humble
and thankful heart, in respect of the rest to whom this
grace is not given, to adore with the apostle the severity
and justice of the judgments of God, but by no means to
scrutinize them curiously.†

8. But as many as are invited by the gospel, are in-
vited sincerely (or in earnest, serio). For sincerely and
most truly Grod shows in his word what is pleasing to
him, namely, that they who are called should come to
him. And he sinoerely promises to all who come to him
and believe, the peace of their souls and eternal life.‡

9. That many who are called by the ministry of the
gospel, do not come and are not oonverted, the fault of
this is not in the gospel, nor in Christ offered by the gos-
pel, nor in God inviting by the gospel, and conferring
various gifts on them, but in the persons themselves who
are invited 3 some of whom being regardless, (or uncon-
oerned, securi,) do not admit the word of eternal life;
others indeed admit it (admittunt), but do not receive

and New Testament, everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ,
who is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God and
man.''-Art. vii. Ohureh of England.
