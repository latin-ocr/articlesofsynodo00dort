those which are established in the Bible ?—(Eclectic Re-
view, May 1817, p. 481).

My concern at present is only with the word compul-
sion. Can it be conceived, that they who voluntarily
come to the Lord's Supper in the Ghurch of England,
consider knecliny as compulsion ,9 And who is at present
compellent to receive the Lord's Supper in that church?
Some indeed are tempted, too strongly tempted, but
none are compelled. Again, would it not excite at least
as much surprise and perplexity in a dissenting congrega-
tion, both to minister and communicants, if one or more
of the company should kneel down to receive the bread
and wine, and refuse to receive them in any other pos-

down, or stand, or refuse to kneel at the time of receiving?
Should thc custom of receiving in a sitting posture be
considered as compulsion, and as a command or prohibi-
tion added to those which are established in the Bible?
By no means. Each company has its usage, whether es-
tablished by law, or by the appointment of an independent
church. That usage is known 3 it is seldom seen that a
communicant expresses the least objection to it. He is
voluntary, or he need not come. Whether kneeling as
uniting solemn prayer with receiving, or sitting, as among
Presbyterians and IndependentS‚ or standing, or reclining
on couches, (the posture no doubt of the apostles, at its
institution,) if it be voluntary in each person, there is no
infringement of liberty, whatever else may bc controverted,
respecting the posture.

But to return to Belgium and the Synod of Dort.
There toleration of dissentients was not thought of, and
thc effort was made to enforcc conformity on thc whole
