260 THE ston or noar.

to explain the established articles in their own favour, or
at least as not against them, add greatly to the difficulty
and evil: and so all discipline is neglected, as facts de-
plorably prove.

Probably, this has been, and is in a measure, the case,
in most or all of the churches3 but the proceedings of
the Synod of Dort, and of the rulers of Belgium at that
season, were more except-ionable than those of any other,
at least as far as I can judge. And this appears to me
the chief blame to which they are justly exposed, but
which is almost, if not wholly, overlooked, in the torrent
of indiscriminate invective in which they, and these trans-
actions, have been long overwhelmed.

THE END.
