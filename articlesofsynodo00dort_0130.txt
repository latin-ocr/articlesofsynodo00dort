of the republic. The Remonstrants judged, that no more
certain method of concord could be entered on than 3
mutual toleration‚ by which each party might be permitted
freely to teach and contend for his own opinion concerning
these articles?¹< The other pastors declared that they
could not show a more advantageous way, than that as

Synod should be called together by the authority of the
illustrious‚ the High Mightinesses‚ the States Genera] 3
in which these and all other controversies having been
clearly explained and examined‚ it might be determined
which opinion agreed with the word of God, and the com-

royal or senatorial mandate, and all preferments in the church and
universities thrown open to men of every creed and character. James
the Second attempted a little in this way in order to bring in popery,
but the dissenters in general opposed this his dispcnsing power, and
few, if any, of modern dissenters, who make the highest claims of
something above toleration, mean such acomplete abolition of the
present stato of things, by the same despotic authority as this implied.
