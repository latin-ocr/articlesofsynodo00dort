SYNOD or Dour. 197

would have repented long ago in sackeloth and ashes.'’
Matt. xi. 21.*

“ That we thus think and judgc‚ we testify by the sub-
scription of our hands.⁷'

Then follows a list of the names of all those who sub-
scribed and attested these articles and refutatione, among
whom are found, George, Bishop of Llandaff, John Dave-
nant, Presbyter, Doctor, and public professor of sacred
theology in the University of Cambridge, and at the same
time president (prensos) of Kiug's College. Samuel
WVard, presbyter, Archdeacon of Taunton, Doctor of
sacred theology, and head of Sidney College of the Uni·
versity of Cambridge Thomas Goad, presbyter, Doc-
tor of sacred theology, and precentor of the cathedral
church of St. Paul, London. Walter Balcanqual (Scoto-
Britannus), a Scotchman, presbyter, Bachelor of sacred
theology; with very many others from various parts of
the continent of Europe, amounting to above eighty.
These were deputed by churches, differing from each
other in various respects, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
and those in some of the regions which are generally ac-
counted Lutheran, and men that occupied the most im-
portant stations in the church and universities of their
several countries3 yet they all subscribed these articles of
the Synod, agreeing in this respect though not in others.
For it cannot be supposed that they who opposed, or were

much dissatisfied with any of the conclusions, would thus
voluntarily and solemnly alces& and subscribe the same

decisions. This consideration should, in all reason, at
least, induce us to give these articles a candid and attentive

’ἓ This shows that the election of nations is really as opposite to the
anti-Calvinist's ideas of divino justice as the electiora of individuals.
