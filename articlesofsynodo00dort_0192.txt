10. Now the cause of this gratuitous electionis the
sole good pleasure of God, (Matt. xi. 26. Eph. i. 5. 1 Tim.
i. 9. J ames i. 18,) not consisting in this, ‘that he elected
into the condition of salvation certain qualities or human
actions from all that were possible 3 but in that, out of
the common multitude of sinners, he took to himself cer-
tain persons as his peculiar property, according to the
Scripture : (ζ For the children being not yet born, neither
having done any good or evil, &c., it is said,'’ (that is, to
Rebecca,) “the elder shall serve the younger, even as
it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”
Rom. ix. 11—13. And “as many as were ordained
(ordinati) to eternal life, believed.” Acts xiii. 48.

11. And as God himself is most wise, immutable, om-
niscient, and omnipotent, so election made by him can
neither be interrupted, changed, recalled, nor broken off 3 ’
nor can the elect be cast away, nor the number of them
be diminished.

12. Of this, his eternal and immutable election to sal-
vation, the elect, though by various steps, and in an un-
equal measure, are rendered certain (or assured), not
indeed by curiously scrutinizing the deep and mysterious
things of God, but by observing in themselves, with
spiritual delight and holy pleat-iure, the infallible fruits of
election described in God's word, such as true saith in
Christ, filial sear of God, sorrow for sin, according unto
God (λύπη κατὰ Θεὸν-(ι Godly sorrow‚'') (2 Cor. vii.10
Gr.) hungering and thirsting after righteousness, &c.*

⁹¹÷ How different is this from the generally circulated opinion, that
they who believe election in the Calvinistic sense, are taught to assume
it a certainty that they are the elect without further evidence ! In
this the vehemcnt opposers‚ and the perverters of the doctrine, seem to

coincide, but no more with the Synod of Dort, than with Peter's
exhortation, 2 Pet. i. 5—10.
