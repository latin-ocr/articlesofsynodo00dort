illustrious person, and never to be mentioned without a
prefaoe of the highest honour.'’ Whoever examines into
the sermons, writings, &c., of our divines in the reign of
Elizabeth, and J ames 1., will continually meet with epi-
thets of honour with which his name is mentioned 3 the
learned, the wise, the judicious, the pious Calvin, are ex-
pressions everywhere to be found in the remains of those
times. It is well known that his Institutes were read
and studied in the universities, by every student in divi-
nityj, nay, that, by a convocation held at Oxford, that
book was recommended to the general study of the nation.
So far were the Church of England, and her chief divines,
from countenancing that unbecoming and absurd treat-
ment with which the name of this eminent Protestant is
now so frequently dishonoured, that it would be no diffi-
cult matter to prove, that there is not, perhaps, a parallel
instance upon record, of any single individua] being
equally, and so unequivocally venerated, for the union of
wisdom and piety, both in England and by a large body
of the foreign churches, as John Calvin. Nothing but
ignorance of the ecclesiastica] records of those times, or
resolute prejudice, could cast a cloak of concealment over
this fact. It has been evidenced by the combined testi-
mony both of enemies and friends to his system of doc-
trines.''>³<
