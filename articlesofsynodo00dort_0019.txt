rises in an evangelica] body, it is never frank and open.
It always begins by skulking, and assuming a disguise.
Its advocates, when together, boast of great improve-
ments, and congratulate one another on having gone
greatly beyond the “old dead orthodoxy,'' and on having
left behind many of its antiquated errors : but when taxed
with deviations from the received saith, they complain of
the unreasonableness of their accusers, as they “differ
from it only in words.” This has been the standing
course of errorists ever since the apostolic age. They are
almost never honest and candid as a party, until they
gain strength enough to be sure of some degree of popu-
larity. Thus it was with Arius in the fourth century,
with Pelagius in the fifth, with Arminius and his com-
panions in the seventeenth, with Amyraut and his asso-
ciates in France soon afterwards, and with the Unitarians
in Massachusetts, toward the close of the eighteenth and
the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. They denied
their real tenets, evaded examination or inquii-y, declaim-
ed against their accusers as merciless bigots and heresy-
hunters, and strove as long as they conld to appear to
agree with the most orthodox of their neighbors ; until
the time came when, partly from inability any longer to
cover up their sentiments‚ and partly because they felt
strong enough to come out, they at length avowed their
real opinions. Arminius, in regard to talents, to learning,
to eloquence, and to general exemplariness of moral de-
portment, is undoubtedly worthy of high praise: but if
there be truth in history, his character as to integrity,
candour, and. fidelity to his official pledges and professione,

is covered with stains which can never by any ingenuity

be effaced.2
