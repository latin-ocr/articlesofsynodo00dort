218 ARTIOLES or* THE

7. Who teach that “in the true conversion of man
there cannot be new qualities, habits, or gifts infused by
God into his will 3 and so saith, by which we are first con-
verted, and from which we are called the faithful, is not
a quality or gift insuscd by God, but only an act of man3
nor can it be otherwise called a gift than with respect to
the power of attaining it.'' For these contradict the holy
ScriptureS, which testify that God doth infuse new qualities
of saith, obedience‚ and a sense of his love into our hearts.
Jer. xxxi. 33. ‘⁶ I will put my law into their mind, and
will write it in their heart.” Isa. xliv. 3. ‘⁴1 will pour
water on him that is athirst, and rivers upon the dry
ground, I will pour out my Spirit on thy secd.’' Rom.
v. 5. “The love of God which is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.'’ They
also contradict the constant practice of the church, ac-
cording to the prophet, praying--“ Convert thou me, and
Ι shall be converted.” Jcr. xxxi. 18, 19. (Ez. xi. 19, 203
xxxvi. 25—27. Eph. i. 19, 203 ii. 8—10.)

7. Who teach “that the grace by which we are con-
verted to God, is nothing else than gentle suasion 3 01·
(as others explain it) the most noble method of acting in
the conversion of man, and the most suitable (convenien-
tissimum) to human nature, is that which is done by sua-
sions, and that nothing hinders that moral grace alone
should render animal (natural, ψυχικὸν) men spiritual, in-
deed Grod produces the consent of the will no otherwise
than by moral reason 3 and the efficacy of divine grace, by
which he overcomes the operation of Satan, consists in

here condemned, compriscs the very hingc on which the whole turns;

issalee, Calvinists, (in the modern use of the word) are right3 if true,
anti-Calvinists are right.
