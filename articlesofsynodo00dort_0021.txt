INTRODUGTORY EssAY. 15

reason to apprehend hostility on the part of Arminius
and his followers, to the essential principles of their crced,
than their published language would seem to intimate.
And the Rev. Dr. Murdoek, the latest and best trans-
lator of Mosheim, has delivered the following opinion,
which will probably commend itself to the judgmcnt of
all well informed and impartial readers.

“Itis a common opinion that the early Arminians,
who fiourished before the Synod of Dort, were much
purer and more sound than the later ones, who lived aud
taught after that council 3 and that Arminius himself only
rejected Calvin's doctrine of absolute decrees, and its ne-
cessary consequences, while, in everything else, he agreed
with the Reformer 3 but that his disciples, and especially
Episcopius, boldly passed the limits which their master
had wisely established, and went over to the camp of the
Pelagians and Socinians. But it appears to me very clear,
that Arminius himself revolved in his own mind, and
taught to his disciples‚ that form of religion which his
followers afterwards professed3 and that the latter, espe-
cially Episcopius, only perfected what their master taught
them, and casting off fear, explained it more clearly. I
have as a witness, besides others of less authority, Ar-
minius himself, who, in his will, drawn up a little before
his death, explicitly declares· that his aim was to bring
all sects of Christians, with the exception of the Papists,
into one community and brotherhood. The opinion that
Arminius himself was very nearly orthodox, and not an
Arminian, in the common acceptation of the term, has
been reeently advocated by Professor Stuart, of Andover,
in 311 article expressly on the Creed of Arminius, in the

Biblioal Repository, No. IL, Andover, 1831, see pp. 293
