own cause to the lawful decision-of the Belgio churehes,
and that it should for that end and purpose, seriously and
sincerely labour that a national Synod of the Reformed
churches should be called together as speedily as might be,
even if it could be done in the next summer, by the authority
of the illustrious and High Mightinesses‚ the States Gen-
eral, in which the whole cause having been lawfully
examined and discussed‚ it might either be determined
which doctrine, as agreeable to the word of God, ought
thenceforth to be taught in the churches, or that the plan
of a toleration might be entered into, by the suffrages of
all the churches of that kind which might appear proper
to be instituted from the word of God. That they were
ready to subject themselves to the judgment of the Synod,
if the Remonstrants were willing to do the same, thus
peace might be accomplished3 but that a toleration such
as they had hitherto used, and such as they seemed to
request, being circumscribed by no laws, could not pro-
mote the peace of the churches‚ but if they would suffer
it to be circumscribed with fair (or honour-able) condiffions,
they were ready to confer with them concerning the same
(conditions)‚ provided they would assure the churches by
a sincere and open declaration, that they thought differently
from these Reformed churches in no other heads of doc-
trine except these five articles.>¹< But since the illustfious,

ἦ “ The demands of the Arminians were moderate3 they required
no more than abare toleration of their religious sentiments3 and
some of the first men in the republic, such as Olden Barneveldt,
Grotius, Hoogerberts‚ and several others, looked upon this demand
as just and reasonable.” (Mosheim, vol. v. p. 442.) “ This tolera-
tion was offered to them in the conference holden at the Hague in

1611, provided they would renounce the errors of Soeinianism.''
