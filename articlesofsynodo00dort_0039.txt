rather than Christians. Still it is believed that even
these secular struggles have been ma-gnified for the sake
of blackening the anti-Arminian body, who happened to
be connected with the strongest politica] party.

In the Church of Holland‚ the majority against the
Remonstrants‚ and in favour of orthodoxy‚ was very large.
J udging from the number of ministers reckoned in the
established chureh„ and among the Remonstrants‚ the
latter did not constitute more than a thirtieth part of the
population. And the proportion remains pretty much
the same still: for although since that time the number
is greatly increased among the ministers of the Dutch
churehes‚ of those who embrace Pelagian and Semi-
Pelagian sentiments, yet many who agree with the Re-
monstrants in doctrina] opinions, and even some who go
much farther in heresy than they, do not take their
name, or unite with their societies‚ as the Remonstrants
labour under civil disabilities, which multitudes who sub-
stantially agree with them in sentiment do not choose to
incur by openly joining their ranks.

After the death of the Prince of Orange, A. D. 1625,
the Remonstrants began to be treated more mildly. The
ministers were reealled from their banishment, and re-
stored to their functions and churches3 and from that
period to the present have been tolerated in the United
Provinces, and more lately, since the change of govern-
ment, in the kingdom of Holland. Indeed‚ it is melan-
choly to say, that for a number of years past, in the
kingdom of Holland, Pelagian and Unitarian sentiments
have obtained such currency in the chureh of that
country, that the only difficulty has been for the friends

of truth to obtain permission to preaeh, unobstructed,
the pure Gospel.
