of the Senate of Amsterdam.‘¹<

About this time, the pastors of Camp in Transylvania,
having embraced the opinion of the Remonstrants, by the
assistance of the magistracy, cast out of the ministry their
most learned colleague, and most tenacious of sound doc-
trine, William Stephanus, because he opposed their at-
tempts 3 and by pamphlets published, and by public ser-
mons full of calumnies, they endeavoured to bring the
Reformed religion into the hatred of the common people.

March, A. D. 1617.] When, on account of these inno-
vations in doctrine, and the disturbances of the churches,
and of the state which followed, they saw that they were
rendered more and more odious, they presented a second
Remonstrance to the States,† in which, with incredible
impudence, they endeavoured to remove from themselves
the crime of innovation, and to fasten the same on those
pastors who most constantly remained in the received

of the Senate of Amsterdam cont-ains more of the spirit of toleration
than any thing which we have yet met with.

‡ Either this whole narrative is false throughout, or this attempt
was made with consummate effrontery‚· not indeed incredible, be-
cause other innovators, both ancient and modern, have endeavoured,
and with succeSS‚ to fasten the charge os innovation on those who
most steadily abode by the doctrine of articles, sac„ subscribed by all
parties. But nothing is incredible, of which several undeniable in-
stanoes may be adduoed.
