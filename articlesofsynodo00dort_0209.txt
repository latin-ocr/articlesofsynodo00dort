God, having abrogated the exaction of perfect legal obe-
dience‚ imputes (reputet) faith itself, and the imperfect
obedience of saith, for the perfect obedience of the law,
and graciously reckons it as deserving of the reward of
eternal life.'' For these contradict the Scriptum, “ They
are justified freely by his grace through the redemption
made in J esus Christ, whom God has set forth as a pro-

unto us all his own mersts, but saith is an instrument by which we
are joined to him in the society or communion of all his goods, and
are retained in it: insomuch that all these having been made ours,
are more than sufficient for us for our absolution from sins.” Belgio
Confession, Art. xxii.
