260 THE SYNOD or noar.

to explain the established articles in their own favour, or
at least as not against, them, add greatly to the difficulty
and evil: and so all discipline is neglected, as facts de-
plorably prove. ⁴

Probably, this has been, and is in a measure, the ease,
in most or all of the ohurehes3 but the proceedings of
the Synod of Dort, and of the rulers of Belgium at that
season‚ were more exceptionable tha-n those of any other,
at least as far as I ean judge. And this appears to me
the chief blame to whieh they are justly exposed3 but
which is almost, if not wholly, overlooked, in the torrent
of indiscriminate invective in whieh they, and these trans-
actions, have been long overwhelmed.

THE END.
