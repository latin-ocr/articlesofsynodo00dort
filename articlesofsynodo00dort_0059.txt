1N‘Taonnc'rossr ESSAY. 53

That the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of Eng-
land are Calvinistic, has been so often asserted and de·
monstrated, that a new attempt to establish the fact is
certainly unnecessary. The seventeenth Article in par-
ticular, bears ample testimony to this fact. I am aware,
indeed, that it has been alleged, that the qualifying
clause toward the end of the Article, shows that the
framers of it meant to reject Calvinism. Now it so hap-
pens that the very qualifying clause in question, is nearly
copied from Calvin’s Institutes, and the latter part of
that clause is a literal translation of that Reformer’s cau-
tion against the abuse of this doctrine. For evidence of
the former, see his Institutes ΠΙ. 21, 4, 5, compared
with the Article, where every idea contained in that part
of the Article will be found recited. For proof of the
latter, read the following: “Proinde, in rebus aqendz's,
ea est nobis perspicienda Dei voluntas quam verbo sao de-
clarat.'’ Instit. I. 17, 5. “ Furthermore, in our doings,
that will of God is to be followed, which we have ex-
pressly declared to us in the word of God.'' Art. 17th.*

A correspondent of the Christian Observer, a cler-gy-
man of the Established Church of England, in speaking
of the disposition of many in his own church, to vilify
the name and opinions of Calvin, makes the following
remarks:

“Few names stand higher, or in more deserved pre-
eminence, among the wise and picus members of the
English Church, than that of Bishop Andrews. His tes-
timony to the memory of Calvin is, that he was ‘an

’ἕ Fon-‚this reference, to show that the 17th Article is not to be in-

terpreted as opposed to Calvinism, see Christian Observer, of Lon-
don, vol. iii. p. 438.
