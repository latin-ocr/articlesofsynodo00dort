least, the chief sufferers, and as their tcncts are generally
more favoured than those of the Synod, the public mind
has greatly favoured the cause of the suffering party.
Yet the Synod and its supporters seem very confident
that the Remonstrants exclusively were in fault, and con-
sider their conduct as intolerablyhaughty and pertina-

who had no sympathy with either party, no partiality or

in incurable scparations, the charge of schism has been
brought with the utmost confidenee (if not bitterness) by
each party against its opponent 3 and, except in one soli-

stance excepted 3 for beyond all doubt, on the broad
ground of Scripture, in the separation of Protestants
from the Roman church, all the guilt of schism rested
with that corrupt body which excluded from its commu-
nion all those who would not worship creatures, or con-
form to anti-christian observances; and in many ways
made it the duty, the absolute duty of all the true wor-
shippers of God through Christ J esus, to come forth and

and other very corrupt passions, powerfully influence both

those who by spiritual tyranny, would lord it over other
