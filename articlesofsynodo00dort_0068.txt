cording to the fas-kion of those times, epithets are in some
instances applied both to men and opinions, which mod-
ern courtesy, nay, perhaps Christian meekness would have
suppressed3 yet, if I mistake not, they are more sparingly
employed in this, than in any contemporary controversial
publication. Indeed, the higher points of what is called

strenuously, nay, severely, condemned. Even Mosheim
allows that the triumph of the Synod was that of the
Sublapsarians, not only over the Arminians, but over the
Supralapsarians also.''<

and general Synods of all the Federated provinces 3 and
with all those rules and methods for admission into the
ministry, and to the pastoral charge in distinct congrega-
tions, as also to situations in Universities and schools of
learning, which form a constituent part of it 3 as well as
of that strict discipline, connected with it, implying not
only excommunication of lay members‚ but the suspension
or silencing of pastors 3 and excluding from thcir office,
academical teachers and professors on account of hercsy
in doctrine, and gross inconsistency of conduct, proved
