good pleasure of God and the merit of Christ are ener-
vated‚ and men are called away by unprofitable disputa-
tions, from the truth of gratuitous justification and the
simplicity of the Scripturcs 3 and that of the apostle is
aecusod of falsehood‚ “ God hath called us with a holy

sufficient to make us eulpable ε yea, to shut us from the kingdom of
heaven„where nothing that is not absolute can enter.''—Hooker.
The error refuted in this article, is as contrary to the doctrine of our
ehuroh as to that of the Synod of Dort.
