168 HISTORY or, Ero.

of the manner of convoking this Synod was questioned by Olden-Bar-
neveldt‚ who maintained that the States General had no sort of au-
thority in matters of religion: affirming that this was an act of
sovereignty that belonged to each province separately‚ and respec-
tively.'’——(Maclaine, Ibid.) ’

It was by means of these disputes about the ecclesiastical authority
(which all parties supposed to be possessed by some of them), that
the union of the confederated States was endangered in this contro-
versy.

“ Dr. Mosheim, however impartial, seems to have consulted more
the authors of one side than of the other, probably because they were
more numerous, and more generally known. When he published this
history, the world had. not been favoured with The Lenem, Memosirs,
and Neqotiations of Sir Dudley Cariet0n‚ which Lord Royston (after-
wards Earl of Hardwicke) drew from his inestimable treasure of his-
torical manuscripts, and presented to the public, or rather at first to
a select number ospersons, to whom he distributed a small number
of copies, printed at his own expense. They were soon translated
both into Dutch and French ς and though it cannot be affirmed that
the spirit of party is nowhere discoverable in them, yet they contain
anecdotos with respect both to Olden-Barneveldt and Grotius, that
the Arminians, and the other patrons of these two great men, have
been studious to conceal. These anecdotos, though they may not be
sufficient to justify the severities exercised against these eminent
men, would, however, have prevented Dr. Mosheim from saying that
he knew not on what pretext they were arrested.'’ (Mosheim, vol.
v„ pp. 449, 450. Note by Maclaine.)

In a political contest for authority, between prince Maurice and
his opponents, in the States General, the Remonstrants favoured his
opponents, and the Contra-Remonstrants were attached to him. The
prince’s party at length prevailed, and “the men who sat at the
helm of government were cast into prison. Olden-Barnoveldt, a man
of wisdom and gravity, whose hairs were grown grey in the service
of his country, lost his life on the public scaffold, while Grotius and
Hoogerberts were condemned to perpetual imprisonment3 under what
pretext, or in consequence ofwhat accusations or crimes, is unknown
to us.’'—(Mosheim, vol. v., pp. 448, 449.)
