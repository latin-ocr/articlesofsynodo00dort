Utenbogardus and Festus to them, that they might know
from them what had been done in this conference at
Delft, and what hopes shone forth of concord being
entered on. Festus sincerely and without disguise (nu-
deque) related what had been done, and declared that
hope of peace shone forth, only provided the Remon-
strants would openly declare their opinion on the articles
delivered to them. Utenbogardus, by courtly craftiness,
had procured that he should be heard alone, Festus being
absent, that he might the more freely propose the things
which he thought would serve his own purpose. And
when he had odiously traduced the proceedings of the
rest of the pastors, as the persons who, by the demand of
a declaration, (which yet before the eonference he him-
self had promised,) endeavoured to bring a new inquisition
into the churches, and one by no means to be endured,
obtained that the same persons should be forbidden any
more to demand this declaration from the Remonstrants,
and moreover, that it should at the same time be enjoined
on them to explain more at large in writing their counsel
on the best way of peace, and concerning the conditions
by which they thought that atoleration should be circum-
scribod. When this had been done by them, and it had
also been shown that the proposed theses concerning which
a declaration had been demanded, were extant in so many
words in the Confession and Catechism of the Belgio

existing laws, grounded on private or partial authority at best, like
King Jamesâ€™s claim of the dispensing power over acts of parliamenta
in matters of religion, and indeed it amounted to a private repeal of
those laws. The others were willing to consent to a legal and limited
toleration. It is also evident that their firm decision and opposition
was not mainly about predestination and reprobation.
