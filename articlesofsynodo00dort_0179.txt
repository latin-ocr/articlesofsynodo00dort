on another way, according to the custom received of old,
in ancient Synods3 and from writings, confessions‚ and
declarations, partly before published, and partly even ex-

following judgment, by which both the true opinion,
agreeing with the word of God, concerning the aforesaid
five heads of doctrine is explained, and the false opinion,
and that discordant with the word of God is rejected,

councils or Synods of some kind, proper measures for
promoting the cause of truth and holiness, and counter-
acting the progress of schism, heresy, and false doctrine,

and in every place where the Reformation was established,
