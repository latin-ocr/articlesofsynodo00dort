fully, with the entire idiom of the English language 3 but
Ι have, even by design, confined myself more closely to
literal translation, than I should have done, in an attempt
less connected with controversy 3 and have often declined
giving a more approved English word 01· expression, when
Ι feared it might be suspected of not exactly conveying
the sense of the original. Indeed, as sar as it could be
made consistent with perspicuity, I have rather preserved
than shwmed the Latin idiom, where any doubt could re-
main as to the idea which the writers intended to convey.
And when, after all, Ι had any apprehension that Ι had
not fully aecomplished this, Ι have given in a parenthesis
the Latin word, that the reader may judge for himself.
In other places, a parenthesis often contains a word not
found in the Latin, but useful in elucidating the meaning.
My sole desire has been, to render the whole clearly un-
derstood by the English read er 3 and to call the attention
of pious and reflecting persons to a part of ecclesiastical
history, which Ι am confident has been generally less
known, and more grossly misrepresented by some, and
mistaken by others, than any other part whatever has
been3 but which, Ι am also persuaded, is peculiarly re-
plete with important useful instruction, especially to
zealous CalvinistS, who may here learn in what a guarded,
and holy, and practical manner, these generally reprobated
theologians, stated and defended their tenets, and on
what grounds, exclusively scriptural, they rested them.
