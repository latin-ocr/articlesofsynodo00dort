SYNOD 01· noar. 185

kept in the communion of his Son, to the demonstration
of his mercy, and the praise of the riches of his glorious
grace, as it is written: “ God hath chosen us in Christ
before the foundations of the world were laid, that we
should be holy and without blame before him in love,
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children, by
Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure
of his will 3 to the praise of the glory of his grace,
wherein he hath freely made us accepted to himself in
that Beloved One.” Eph. i. 4—6. And in another place,
“ Whom he did predestinate, them he also called3 and
whom he called, them he also justified ; and whom he
justified, them he also glorified.'’ Rom. viii. 30.

8. This election is not multiform, but one and the
same of all that shall be saved, in the Old and N ew Tes-
tament, seeing that the Scripture declares the good plea-
sure, purpose, and counsel of the will of God, by which
he has, from eternity, ehosen us to graec and glory: both
to salvation and the way of salvation, which he hath “ be-
fore prepared that we should walk in it.'’ 2 Thess. ii.
13, 14. 1 Pet. i. 2.

9. This same election is not made from any foreseen
saith, obedienee of saith, holiness, or any other good
quality and disposition, as a prerequisz‘te cause or con-
dition in the man who should be elected, but unco saith,
and unco the obedienee of faith, holiness, &c. And, there-
fore, (or truly, proinde,) election is the fountain of every
saving benefit; whence saith, holiness, and the other sal-
utaryssgifts, and finally, eternal life itself, flow as its fruit
and effect, according to that word of the apostle: “He
hath ehosen us (not because we were, but) that we ‘miylzt

be holy, and without blame before him in love.'' Eph. i. 4.
