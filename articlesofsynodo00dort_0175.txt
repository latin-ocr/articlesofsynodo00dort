PREFACE.

In the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Amen.

Among very many comforts which our Lord and Sa-
viour J esus Christ hath given to his own church militant,
in this calamitous pilgrimage‚ that which he left unto
it when about to go away to his Father, into the heavenly
sanctuary, saying, “ I am with you at all times, even unto
the end of the world‚” is deservedly celebrated. The
truth of this most delightful promise shines forth in the
church of all ages, which, whilst it has been besieged
from the beginning, not only by the open violence of
enemies‚ but also by the secret crastiness of seducers, truly
if at any time the Lord had deprived it of the salutary
guard of his own promised presence, had long since been
either crushed by the power of tyrants‚ or seduced into

destruction by the fraud of impostors.
