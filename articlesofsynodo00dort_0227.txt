sruon or Dour. 221

2. Hence daily sins of infirmity arise, and blemishes
(noevi) cleave to the best works even of the saints, which
furnish to them continual cause (materiam) of humbling
themselves before God, of fleeing to Christ crucified, of
mortifying the fiesh more and more by the spirit of
prayer, and the holy exercises of piety, and of panting
after the goal of perfectiori (acl petfecczbnis metam suspi-
randi) until the time when, delivered from this body of
death, they shall reign with the Lamb of God in the
heavens.*

3. Because of these remains of indwelling sin, and
moreover, also, the temptations of the world and of Sa-
tan, the converted could not continue (perstare) in this
grace, if they were left to their own strength. But God
is faithful, who confirms them in the grace once merci-
fully conferi-ed on them, and power-fully preserves them
in the same, even unto the end.†

4. But though that power of God, confirming the truly

they flee from sin and follow after righteousness ; at the same time
they love the true God and their neighbours, neither turning aside to
the right hand nor to the left: they crueify the flesh with its affec-
tions, but by no means this indeed, as if there were not in them any
longer infirmity: but that they fight against it through the whole
time of their life, by the enei-gy (virtutem) of the Holy Spirit3 and
in the mean time they flee to the blood, the death, and the suffering-s
and obedience of our Lord Christ, as to their most safe protection.’'

of those days held, it seems, the doctrine of sinless perfectiori in this
life more yenerally than anti-Calvinists do at present.

ἕ “ Not that they should slumber, trusting in this remission, but
that the feeling of this corruption may excite in the faithful more
frequent groans; and that they may wish more ardently to be freed
from this body of death. Rom. vii. 18, 243⁹ Belgio Confessi0n‚ Art. xv.
