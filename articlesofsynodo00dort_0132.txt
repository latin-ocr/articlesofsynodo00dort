with the same 3 but that they chose rather to go to the
sermons of orthodox pastors in the adjacent places, though
they were exposed to many reproaches, disgraces, and in-

wishes and claims of the advocates for toleration, who in this trans-
action, as in many others, are imposcd upon by a favourite term,
however misapplicd?
