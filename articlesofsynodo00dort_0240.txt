from the calumnies heaped together from this and the
other quarter (hinc inde), nor even from the private say-
ings of certain individuals‚ as well ancient as modern

01111011οΧ doctrine, confirmed by the unanimous consent
of all, and every 0110, of the members of this whole Synod.

have been thus brought forward ;Δ 01111 nothing but to show the real
spirit of these controversialists‚ could excuse the repeating of it,
either by the Synod, or 111 11113 publication.

† This solemn warning is quite as seasonable in Britain at present
as it was in Belgium in the scventcenth century.
