3. Who teach that “true believers and regenerate
persons may not only fall from justifying saith, and in
like manner from grace and salvation, totally and finally,
but likewise that in fact (re ipsa) they not seldom do fall
from it, and perish eternally.'’ For this opinion renders
vain the grace itself of justification and regeneration‚ and
the perpetual guardian care (custodiam) of Christ, con-
trary to the express words of the apostle Paul. Rom. v.
8, 9. “ If Christ died for us while we were yet sinners‚
much more, therefore, being now justified through his
blood, we shall be saved from wrath by him.” And,
contrary to the apostle John, (l John iii. 9,) “ Every one
that is born of God doth not commit sin, because his
⁷ seed remaineth in him 3 neither can he sin, because he is
born of God.⁷⁷ Also, contrary to the words of J esus Christ,
(John x. 28, 29,) “ Ι give eternal life to my sheep, and
they shall never perish, neither shall any one tear them
violently out of my hand3 my Father who gave them me
is greater than all, neither can any one tear them vio-
lently out of my Father's hand.'’

4. Who teach that “ true believcrs and the regenerate
may sin the sin unto death, or against the Holy Spirit.”
But the same apostle, John, chap. v., after, in the loth
and 17th verses, he has mentioned those who sin unto
death, and forbidden to pray for thern, immediately, ver.
18, adds, “We know, that whosoever is born of God,
sinneth not,'' (namely, in that kind of sin) “but hc that
is born of God, keepeth himself, and that wicked one
toucheth him not.''

5. Who teach that ί( no certainty of future perseve-
rance can be had in this life without special revelation.'’

For by this doctrine solid consolation is taken away from
