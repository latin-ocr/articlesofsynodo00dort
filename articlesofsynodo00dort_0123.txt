111616 from the principal state of the controversy, and the
right manner of treating it into doubtful disputations
(awzbayes).* The pastors‚ having shown by a libel (libel-
lum) to the illustrious‚ the States, this unjust way of
proceeding, did not indeed entreat that they might not
manifest their own opinion concerning reprobation3 as
the Remonstrants had too often iniquitously (improbe)
objected to the same persons3 but declared expressly their
opinion, as far as they thought might suffice for the peace
and edification of the churchcs‚ not only by word of mouth,
but also 16 writing 3 that indeed when they state the eter-
nal decree conoerning the 61661166 of individua] persons,
they at the same time state the eternal decree concerning
the reprobation or rejection of certain individual persons 3
because it could not be, that there should be election‚ but
moreover there must be, at the same time, a certain re-
probation or dereliction. Yet to rashly canvass all these
difficult questions concerning this article, was nothing
else but to fill the church with useless disputations and
contentions not profitable, and to disturb its peace. That
this their declaration suppliantly expressed in this libel,
ought to suffice all men of moderate dispositions and lov-
ers of peace: namely, that it was indeed believed and
taught by them, that God condemned no one 3 yea, neither
had he decreed to condemn any one, unless justly for his
own proper sins.†

called “ throwing dust 16 men’s eyes.'’

† “ That God, by an absolute decree, had elected to salvation a.
very small number of men, without any regard to their saith and
obedience* whatever3 and secluded from saving grace all the rest of
mankind, and appointed them by the same decree to eternal damna-
tion‚ without any regard to their infidelity or impcnitency.’' Hey-
lin’s lst Article of the Synod of Dort.
