PREGEDING EVEN'rsL 153

The States General, when they saw that by this method
the provinces were brought into extreme danger', judged
that the calling of a national Synod must no longer bc
delayed, but be hastened at the earliest opportunity 3
especially when Dudley Carleton, the ambassador of the
King of Great Britain, by a very weighty and prudent
speech, had earnestly stirred up their Illustrious High-
nesses to the same. This oration the Remonstrants after-
wards were not afraid publicly to revile, in a most impu-
dent and most calumniating pamphlet, to which they gave
the title of Bilancz's ; sparing with a slanderous tongue no
order of men, not the States, not the Prince of Orange‚
yea, not even the King of Great Britain. This pamphlet
the States General condemned by a public edict as scan-
dalous and seditione, having offered a most ample reward
if any one could point out the author. Afterwards J ο.
Casimirus J unius, the son of the most celebrated Fran-
cis Junius, not unlike his father, (haud deyenem) co-
piously refuted the same. Therefore the States decreed
the convoking of a national Synod, at length, in the name
of the Lord, to be held on the first day of May in the fol-
lowing year 3 and at the same time they enacted some
laWS, according to which they willed as well that the con-
vocation should be instituted, as the Synod itself held.
But because the Remonstrants did not appear greatly to
regard the judgment of the Belgic churches, and had
always endeavoured to persuade the people that they did
questioned, when such seditious, if not treasonable practices, were
proved against them from their own letters. It seems evident from
this history that recourse to arms, in the first instance at least, was
had by the party of the Remonstrants, and in opposition to existing
laws. This is not generally understood. The rights of conscience,

and the toleration arising from the recognition of it, seems to have
been equally unthought of by both parties.
