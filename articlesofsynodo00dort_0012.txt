1552, according to some, had taught very much the
same doctrine, though justly regarded as infamous on
account of his shameful moral delinquencies. And about
fifteen or twenty years before Arminius arose, Corvinus,
in Holland, had appeared as the advocate of opinions of
similar import. But having less talent than Arminius,
and being less countenanced by eminent men, his error
made little noise, and was suffered quietly to sink into
insignificance‚ until a stronger and more popular man
arose to give it new consequence, and a new impulse.

J ames Arminius, or Harmensen, was born at Oudwater,
in south Holland, in the year 1560. His father died
when he was an infant, and he was indebted to the cha-
rity of several benevolent individuals for the whole of his
education. At one time he was employed as a servant at
a public inn,‘¹< and in this situation was so much noticed
for his activity, intelligence, wit, and obliging deport-
ment, th'at numbers became interested in his being en·
abled to pursue the cultivation of his mind. Accordingly,
by one of his patrons, he was placed, for a time, in the
University of Utrecht 3 on his decease, by another, in the
University of Marpurg, in Hesse 3 and finally, by a third,
in that of Leyden. In 1582, in the twenty-second year
of his age, the magistrates of Amsterdam had received
such impressions of his promising talents, and of his dili-
gent application‘to study, that they sent him, at the pub-
lic expense, to Geneva, which was then considered as the
great centre of theological instruction for the Reformed
Churches. In that far-famed institution Theodore Beza
then presided, with equa] honour to himself, and accept-
