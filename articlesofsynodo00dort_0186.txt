ΤΗΕ SYNOD OF DORT.

The Articles of the Synod of Dort, Heylin introduces
in this mannerz—“Because particular men may some-
times be mistaken in a public doctrine, and that the judg-
ment of such men being collected by the hands of their
enemies, may be unfaithfully related, we will next look
on the conclusions of the Synod of Dort, which is to be
conceived to have delivered the genuine sense of all the
parties, as being a representative of all the Calvinian
Churches of Europe, (except those of France‚) some few
divines of England being added to them. Of the calling
and proceedings of this Synod we shall have occasion to
speak further in the following chapter. At this time I
shall only lay down the results thereof in the five contro-
Verted points (as I find them abbreviated by Dan. Tile-
nus) according to the heads before mentioned in sunnning
up the doctrine of the Council of Trent.” (Refutation
of Calvinism‚ p. 566.)

Α few things may here be noted—Is it very probable
that such decided anti-Calvinists as Heylin or Collier
should be impartial in their account of this celebrated
Synod? Is it to be supposed that there was no difference

of sentigpenf among the persons of whom it was com-
