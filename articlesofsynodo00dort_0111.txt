PREGEDING nvnnrs. 105

deputies of the ehurches going to Alcmar treated with
the pastors of that Classis concerning this admission, and
so far prevailed on them that they were ready to admit
the pastors attached to Venator, on honourable conditions

(or equitable, honestis) 3 but they laid before the deputies
so many and weighty reasons why they could not admit
Venator himself, that they themselves judged that, in

this respect, they ought not to be urged. When this had
been reported to the illustrious, the States, not even yet
could the calling of a Synod be obtained. For indeed the
pastors attached to Arminius effected this, that it should
be again enjoined to the Classis of Alcmar, unreservedly
to admit these pastors without any condition 3 which when

they could not do, the calling (of the Synod) was again
hindered.*

Arminius in the meanwhile excused himself to the il-
lustrious States by letters 3 that by reason of bodily weak-
ness he was not able to prepare the writing enjoined him 5

ἕ “ These measures confirmed instead of removing the apprehen-
sions of the Calvinist85 from day to day they were still more firmly
persuaded that the Arminians aimed at nothing less than the ruin
of all religion ; and hence they censured their magistrates with great
warmth and freedom, for interposing their authority to promote
peace and union with such adversaries. And those who are well
informed and impartial, must candidly acknowledge, that the Armin-
ians were far from being sufficiently cautious in avoiding connections
with persons of loose principles; and by frequenting the company
of those whose sentiments were entirely different from the received
doctrines of the Reformed chureh‚ they furnished their enemies with
a pretext for suspecting their own principles, and representing their
theologica! system in the worst eolours.”—-(Mosheim, vol. v. p. 445.)
It seems' evident that they patronized men not only of loose prinei-
ples, but of licentious character. The word calvinista is not used
in the historical preface of the Synod of Dort.
