100 HISTORY or

when the orthodox could not do, because of their eon-
seienee, they submissively requested the illustrious, the
States, that they might not be burdened by mandates of
this kind, which they could not eonscientiously obey. The
deputies of the ehurehes, when they saw that these dis-
sensions and seandals were daily more and more increased,
again earnestly entreated (or adjured, obtestati sunt) the
illustrious, the States, in the name of the churehes, that
the promised provincial Synod might be called together
at the earliest time, for the removal of these evils. But
when Utenbogardus, and the rest of the pastors addieted
to Arminius, observed the minds of the illustrious lords,
the States, to incline to this, in order that they might
avoid the ecclesiastieal decisions, they effeeted, by certain
individuals who seemed more attached to their cause, that
in the stead of the provincial Synod, a eonferenee, eon-
eerning the eontroverted articles between Gomarus and
Arminius, should be held, in the convention itself, of the
illustrious States 3 in the which each might take to him-
self four pastors, whose eounsels they might be allowed
to use. Arminius had taken Jannes Utenbogardus, of
Hague, Adrian Borrius of Leyden, Nieholas Grevineho-
vius of Rotterdam, and the before mentioned Adolphus
Venator of the Alemarian ehureh. But Gomarus (took)
Ricardus Acronius of Seheidam, James Roland of Am-
sterdam, John Bogardus of Harlem, and Festus Hom.-
mius of Leyden, pastors of the ehureh.

When they had come together, Gomarus and the pas-
tors, who had joined themselves to him, requested these
two things: 1. That this eonferenee should be instituted
in writingâ€š to be exhibited on each side 5 by whieh means,
vain rumours of whatever kind might be eounteracted.
