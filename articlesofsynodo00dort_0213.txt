attain to the saving knowledge of God, or to turn him-
self to him, he does not use it rightly in natural and civil
things 3 nay, indeed, whatever thing it may at length bc,
hc contaminates it all in various ways, and holds it in
unrighteousness‚ which when he does he is rendered in-
excusable before God.*

5. The reason (or purport or purpose, ratio) of the
decalogue‚ particularly delivered from God by Moses to
the J eWS, is the same as that of the light of nature3 for
when indeed it exposes the magnitude of sin, and more
and more convicts man of gusst, yet it neither discloses a
remedy, nor confers the power ofemerging from misery 5
so that, being rendered weak through thc transgression
of the flesh, it leaves him under the curse, and man can-
not through it obtain saving grace.†

6. What, therefore, neither the light of nature nor the
law could do, that God performs by the power of the Holy
spirit, through the word, or the ministry of reconciliationj,
which is the Gospel eoncerning the Messiah‚ by which it
hath pleased God to save believers, as well under the Old
as under the N ew Testament.‡

ἓ Man by the fall “ entirely withdrew himself from God, (his true
life,) and alienated himself, his nature having been wholly vitiated
and corrupted by his sin 3 by which it came to pass, that he rendered
himself obnoxious as well to corporeal as to spiritual death. There-
fore, having become wicked and perverse, and in all his ways and
pursuits (studiis) corrupt, he lost all those excellent gifts with which
he (God) had adorned him3 so that only small sparks and slender
remains (vestv'qia) of thern are left to him, which yet suffice to render
men inexcusable‚ because whatever there is in us of light hath been
turned into blind darkness.” Rom. i. 18. 20 5 ii. 1, 12, 16. Eph. iv.
