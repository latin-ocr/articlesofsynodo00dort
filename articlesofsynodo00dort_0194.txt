to be elected, but that some are non-elect, or passed by
in the eternal election of God, whom truly God, from
most free, just, irreprehensible, and immutable good
pleasure, decreed to leave in the common misery, into
which they had, by their owu fault, cast themselves, and
not to bestow on them living saith, and the grace of con-
version 5 but having been left in their own ways, and un-
der just judgment, at length, not only on account of their

violation of the command, “ Thou shalt not bear false witness against
thy neighbour ?’' Or are not Calvinists to be considered as neigh-

nality? Is this the moral practice which is contended for by anti-
calvinists ?
